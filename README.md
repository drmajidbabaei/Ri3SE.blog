# How to run it locally?

You need to take the following steps according to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23801899/bundlergemnotfound-could-not-find-rake-10-3-2-in-any-of-the-sources):

1. Clone the project from `https://github.com/drmajidbabaei/Ri3SE.blog.git`
2. Move to the dir `cd Ri3SE.blog`
3. Run `gem install jekyll bundler`
4. Run `bundle install --no-deployment`
5. Build the site and make it available on a local server. `bundle exec jekyll serve`
6. Browse to `http://localhost:4000`

> Note: When you update any files, you don't need to rebot the server! HTML files will be generated automatically :)
